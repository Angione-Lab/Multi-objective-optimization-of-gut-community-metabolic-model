# Multi-objective-optimization-of-gut-community-metabolic-model
Starting from Heinken and Thiele's HS/All genome-scale metabolic model of eleven bacterial species and Recon 2 human host (2015), we devise a system for testing the impact of different dietary regimes on metabolic flux in the human gut.
