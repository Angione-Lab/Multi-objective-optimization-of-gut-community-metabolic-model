# Multi-objective-optimization-of-gut-community-metabolic-model
Starting from Heinken and Thiele (2015) genome-scale metabolic model HS/All of eleven bacterial species and Recon 2 human host (2015), we devise a system for testing the impact of different dietary regimes on metabolic flux in the human gut. 

Flux balance analysis is carried out using the COBRA Toolbox in MATLAB (R2017b), with the solver glpk.
